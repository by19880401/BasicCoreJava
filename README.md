# BasicCoreJava

It seems like a Java tool, normally I will check in some code cases that I met when developing.
Here we go!

Code Structure:
com.example: common demos
com.szewec: the demos where I'm working on SZEWEC
com.xxx: the demos where I'm working on xxx
                                                                         --Willis Bai （白杨）
